00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,548
Hello and welcome back to Apple Park.

3
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,551
I am so glad you could join us today.

4
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:28,522
Just last month we were here to introduce some great new products:

5
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,557
Apple Watch Series 6,

6
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,626
Apple Watch SE,

7
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,729
as well as the eighth-generation iPad

8
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,298
and the all-new iPad Air.

9
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,269
And we've got some more huge announcements for you today.

10
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:45,772
So let's get started with an exciting new product for the home

11
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,941
we know you're going to love.

12
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:53,080
This year, our homes have become even more important in our daily lives.

13
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:56,483
So it's critical that the technology we choose for our home

14
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,386
provides a truly great experience.

15
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,055
When we approach designing products for the home,

16
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,325
we focus on three key attributes:

17
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:08,095
First, they must be easy to use,

18
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,999
from the initial setup to the way you interact with it every day.

19
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:18,305
And we design our products to work better together, seamlessly and intuitively.

20
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:23,010
We also design them to be secure and to protect your privacy.

21
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:27,481
Because you should be the one in control of how your personal data is used.

22
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:31,885
We applied these principles when we created HomePod.

23
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,954
HomePod is a breakthrough speaker

24
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:39,426
that combines precise, high-fidelity sound with the intelligence of Siri.

25
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:44,765
It provides an entirely new way to discover and interact with music at home.

26
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:50,204
And now we want to bring this experience to even more people.

27
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,210
So today, I'm excited to introduce the newest addition to the HomePod family.

28
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,478
And I'd like to show it to you now.

[music continues]

34
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:42,189
I'm so excited to tell you about HomePod mini.

35
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,358
It's an incredible smart speaker,

36
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,427
with a compact, elegant design that's perfect for your home.

37
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:51,899
It's wrapped in a beautiful, seamless mesh fabric that not only looks great,

38
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,035
but was created specifically for its acoustic performance.

39
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,138
On top of HomePod mini is a backlit touch surface

40
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:01,008
that provides controls for volume, play/pause,

41
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,277
and even illuminates when you invoke Siri.

42
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,679
But the design is just the beginning.

43
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,148
In creating HomePod mini,

44
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,918
we thought carefully about what you want from a smart speaker.

45
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,189
First, you want amazing sound that ensures your music, podcasts

46
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,025
and everything you listen to sounds incredible.

47
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,727
Next, you want a world-class intelligent assistant

48
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,729
that helps you wherever you are.

49
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,398
And as our homes become smarter,

50
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,834
you want it to serve as the brain of your smart home,

51
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,270
orchestrating and controlling a wide range of devices.

52
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,140
And finally, because it's your home, you want a smart speaker

53
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:36,743
that puts your privacy and security at the forefront.

54
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,247
All this is exactly what HomePod mini is designed to deliver.

55
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,050
And to tell you more about how we made this happen,

56
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,918
let me pass it to Dave and Yael.

57
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,091
At Apple, we have a passion for music,

58
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:54,094
so we knew HomePod mini had to sound amazing.

59
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,564
We started by custom-designing every acoustic element.

60
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,967
We created a full-range dynamic driver

61
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,337
that delivers high output while keeping distortion to a minimum

62
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:07,341
and developed a pair of high-excursion, force-cancelling passive radiators

63
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,743
that enable amazing bass response.

64
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,145
We also crafted an acoustic waveguide

65
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,716
to deliver a consistent, 360-degree sound experience,

66
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,652
enabling you to place HomePod mini anywhere.

67
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,055
In order to get truly big sound out of this compact design,

68
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,858
we combined it with the powerful Apple S5 chip

69
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:28,662
and advanced software which all together enables something we call...

70
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,664
computational audio.

71
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,566
Even before you hear the first note,

72
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,736
HomePod mini is analyzing the unique characteristics of the music

73
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,906
and applying complex tuning models to optimize loudness,

74
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,440
adjust the dynamic range,

75
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:44,745
and control the movement of the driver and passive radiators in real time.

76
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,981
And all this happens over 180 times a second.

77
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:52,252
The result is an audio experience unheard of in a speaker this size

78
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,055
and one only Apple can deliver.

79
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,257
Now, bringing amazing sound into your home

80
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,493
isn't just about breakthrough audio quality.

81
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,763
It's also about letting you enjoy that sound throughout your house.

82
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,431
Multiple HomePod mini speakers

83
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,334
can play perfectly in sync across your entire house.

84
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,802
That's great for entertaining

or keeping up with your favorite podcast as you get stuff done.

86
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,640
And when you place two in the same room,

87
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,943
they'll intelligently become a stereo pair,

88
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,679
filling your space with rich, enveloping sound.

97
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,466

And of course, HomePod mini can play all of your favorite content.

103
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,815
In addition to Apple Music,

104
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,017
you can listen to all your favorite podcasts,

105
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,819
along with thousands of radio stations

106
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:02,189
from iHeartRadio, RADIO.COM and TuneIn.

107
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,490
And in the coming months,

108
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:07,528
you'll be able to use services from providers like Pandora and Amazon.

109
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,163
And because HomePod mini has the power of Siri,

110

anyone in the home can ask to play an artist, album or track,

111
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,570
hear a playlist, or even search for music by lyrics.

Siri on HomePod mini brings you the music you love

116

and helps you discover new favorites.

117
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,687
But of course, Siri does more than just play your favorite music.

To tell you more, here's Yael.

119
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,128
Siri is what makes a smart speaker, well, smart.

120
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,531
Siri was the first mainstream intelligent assistant,

121
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,301
and today it's the most popular in the world,

122
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,536
available on over a billion devices

123
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,673
and handling over 25 billion requests a month.

124
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,875
And Siri keeps getting better.

125
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:58,946
In the past three years, Siri's gotten faster and more concise.

126
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,448
Speech recognition is twice as accurate.

127
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,651
And Siri knows over 20 times more facts.

128
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,653
Together, Siri and HomePod mini

129
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,256
do everything you'd expect from a smart speaker,

130
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,292
from multiple timers and alarms to weather reports

131
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,195
to answering the random questions kids think up.

132
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,664
But what really sets HomePod mini apart

133
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,434
is Siri's deep integration with iPhone.

134
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,770
Using Siri, HomePod mini can access the apps on your iPhone

135
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,307
to send a message, check your calendar, make a call,

136
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,909
even find your iPhone.

137
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,244
And because of this,

138
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,980
you'll be able to ask HomePod mini for a personal update

139
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,648
with just a single request.

140
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,717

<i>You have one upcoming reminder: call Zoe.</i>

145

Of course, your voice isn't the only voice in your house.

146
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,099
Siri knows that

147
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:55,302
and can recognize the voices of each member of your household

148
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,305
so that everyone gets their own personal experience.

149
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,374

Ask HomePod mini what time Target closes

156
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,093
and a Siri suggestion automatically appears in CarPlay,

157
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,164
so when you hop in the car, the route is ready and waiting for you.

158

Next, let's turn to the smart home.

161
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,976
When it comes to your home, you want comfort and convenience

So with HomePod mini, we've made the smart home simple.

164
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,585
HomePod mini automatically integrates with the Home app

165
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:48,555
so you can control all of your HomeKit accessories with just your voice.

dim the lights,

169
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,596

to control lighting, security, comfort and more.

177
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,185
One of the most important parts of the smart home

178
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:20,454
is communicating with your family,

179
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:22,155
which is why we created...

180
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,557
Intercom.

181
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,527
Intercom lets you quickly send a message from one HomePod

182
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,462
to another in a different room

183
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,664
or to multiple rooms throughout your home.

184
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,967
Hey Siri, tell everyone, "We're late. Let's go!"

187
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,907
Hey Siri, reply, "I'm just getting my jacket."

188
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,911
But what's really exciting is that we've taken it a step further

189
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,047
and designed Intercom to also work with your iPhone,

190
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:50,017
iPad, Apple Watch and even CarPlay,

191
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,486
something only Apple can do.

192
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:55,756
You'll get a home intercom system that goes everywhere with you.

193
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,225
[Moe] Ask everyone, "Who's hungry? I've got pizza."

195
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,995
on HomePod speakers throughout the home,

196
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:05,933
and a notification will appear on your family's personal devices.

197
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,036
And Intercom messages will play on AirPods as well,

198
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,138
so you can always get your kid's attention.

["JEWELZ" by Anderson .Paak playing]

Intercom helps connect the members of your home

202
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,719
in an entirely new way.

203
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,921
We're so excited about how HomePod mini

204
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:31,792
brings the power of Siri intelligence to your smart home.

205
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,126
Back to Bob.

206
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,934
Not only is HomePod mini packed with great features,

207
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,603
like every Apple product

208
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:46,406
it's designed with your privacy and security in mind.

209
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:50,844
Nothing you say is sent out of your home until you activate Siri with a touch

210
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,814
or it hears those magic words, "Hey Siri."

211
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,750
And your requests are not associated with your Apple ID,

212
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,987
and you choose whether Apple saves your audio recordings.

213
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,857
Personal requests only work when your iPhone is home with you,

214
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:07,995
and all communication with smart home accessories uses strong encryption.

215
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:11,598
We can't wait for you to enjoy the incredible experiences

216
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,901
the new HomePod mini brings to your home.

217
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,037
It comes in both white and space gray,

218
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:20,474
and I'm thrilled to announce that HomePod mini will be available

219
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,943
for just $99.

220
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,079
And you can order HomePod mini November 6th,

221
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:29,249
and it will start shipping the week of November 16th.

222
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,385
So that's HomePod mini.

223
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,687
With the power of computational audio,

And now back to Tim.

228
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:03,150
Now let's talk about iPhone.

229
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:07,621
iPhone is an incredibly powerful and personal device.

230
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:10,791
It's the product we use the most every day.

231
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:14,661
With amazing capabilities, iPhone has changed our lives

232
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:18,131
and has never been more indispensable than it is now.

233
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,768
It's been another big year for iPhone.

234
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:28,075
Ever since its launch, iPhone 11 has been the most popular smartphone in the world.

235
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,477
People love their iPhones.

236
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:33,847
iPhone has led the industry in customer satisfaction

237
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:36,750
every year since it was first introduced.

238
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,820
There's so much that people love about their iPhones.

239
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,055
They love how easy it is to use,

240
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,691
how it connects people in personal ways,

241
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,860
how it elevates photography,

242
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,930
keeps us informed and keeps us entertained.

243
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:53,367
With a powerful ecosystem of apps in the App Store,

244
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:57,671
iPhone enables people to do more and more things every day.

245
00:13:57,738 --> 00:14:02,142
And users can trust that iPhone is designed to do all of this

246
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,445
while protecting their security and privacy.

247
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,183
Every decade, there's a new generation of technology

248
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:13,187
that provides a step change in what we can do with our iPhones.

249
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:16,657
The next generation is here.

250
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,960
Today is the beginning of a new era for iPhone.

251
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:24,164
Today we're bringing 5G to iPhone.

252
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:28,836
This is a huge moment for all of us, and we're really excited.

253
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:33,907
5G will bring a new level of performance for downloads and uploads,

254
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:37,878
higher quality video streaming, more responsive gaming,

255
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:41,215
real-time interactivity and so much more.

256
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,650
5G networks are more advanced,

257
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,987
with lower latency and less network congestion.

258
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:51,625
So you can get higher network speeds even in densely populated areas.

259
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:55,696
And 5G even helps protect your privacy and security,

260
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,398
since you won't need to connect to unknown, unsecured,

261
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,968
public Wi-Fi hotspots as often.

262
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:05,339
Each generation of cellular network technology on iPhone

263
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,875
has enabled breakthrough innovations

264
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:12,646
and entirely new opportunities for our developers and our users.

265
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:16,583
And 5G is the most exciting step yet.

266
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:22,022
For so many people, this all becomes real with 5G coming to iPhone.

267
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,792
As you know, iPhone provides seamless integration

268
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:29,229
of world-class hardware and world-class software.

269
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,400
What you may not know about is the incredible collaboration

270
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:37,037
between Apple and our carrier partners around the world

271
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,841
to ensure iPhone users get the best possible experience.

272
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:45,212
We're fortunate today to have one of our closest partners join us.

273
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,149
I'd like to welcome Hans Vestberg, Chairman and CEO of Verizon,

274
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:50,684
here to Apple Park.

275
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,489
Hans, this really is a big day.

276
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:58,525
And our teams have done some amazing work together.

277
00:15:58,592 --> 00:16:00,661
I want to thank you and the whole Apple team

278
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:04,331
for a fantastic collaboration leading up to this historic moment.

279
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:09,469
Until now, most people have taken a "wait and see" approach to 5G.

280
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,339
They've been waiting for 5G to get real...

281
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:14,141
with the network coverage they expect,

282
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,510
the incredible performance they have been promised,

283
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:18,378
and the devices they love.

284
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,748
Well, today with iPhone, the wait is over.

285
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,618
5G just got real.

286
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:27,621
Of course, what's the most exciting part for me

287
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:31,692
as a guy who has worked in networking for 25-plus years?

288
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,695
That fact that for the first time ever,

289
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:39,333
iPhone can now access Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband.

290
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,337
It's built with large quantities of mmWave spectrum

291
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,306
that enable unprecedented performance.

292
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:49,676
5G Ultra Wideband has already been recognized

293
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:53,146
as being the fastest 5G in the world.

294
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,382
And it's getting even faster.

295
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:59,219
Our 5G network now gives you double the peak download speeds:

296
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:03,090
over 4 gigabits per seconds today in ideal conditions

297
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,959
and even higher over time.

298
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:11,031
And double the upload speeds at over 200 megabits per second.

299
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:14,835
So whenever you're watching a high-definition movie

300
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:19,306
or you're planning business workflows with real-time augmented reality,

301
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:23,076
you can be sure that there's no faster 5G anywhere on earth.

302
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:27,281
5G Ultra Wideband has, also, a massive capacity.

303
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:31,018
We're building it to help remove bottlenecks in crowded places

304
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:34,054
where thousands of people use their phones at the same time.

305
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,925
Because one day we'll be safely back in those places.

306
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:42,362
And so, we're nearly doubling our 5G-enabled stadiums,

307
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,499
venues, airports, train stations,

308
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:49,436
and lighting up some of the busiest locations in the country.

309
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,138
This enables amazing things,

310
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:54,408
like reinventing the in-stadium fan experience

311
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,510
with our NFL partners.

312
00:17:56,577 --> 00:18:00,647
The new Verizon 5G SuperStadium experience in the NFL app

313
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:03,317
lets fans see and feel the action

314
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:08,622
from up to seven camera angles, including views from players' eyes,

315
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:12,159
and an immersive augmented reality like never before.

316
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:16,129
We're excited for NFL to be rolling this out to many stadiums

317
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,998
through the course of the season.

318
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:23,437
And finally, 5G Ultra Wideband provides you with super low latency,

319
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,939
so experiences like multiplayer gaming

320
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:28,909
feel like they're happening in near real time,

321
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:31,411
freed from the confines of your home.

322
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:33,247
Together with Apple,

323
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:37,317
Verizon has partnered with one of the world's leading gaming companies

324
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:40,854
for some exciting news that you'll hear about later today.

325
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:44,791
To make this incredible experience available to more people,

326
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,828
we're doubling down on our fastest network,

327
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:50,330
the 5G Ultra Wideband,

328
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,566
with double the coverage in existing cities

329
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,669
like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles,

330
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:59,673
and expanding into new cities like Philadelphia and San Francisco,

331
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,009
with 60 cities by year-end.

332
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,612
In addition to our 5G Ultra Wideband network,

333
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,081
we have an extensive 5G network.

334
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,951
And today, we're excited to announce

335
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:16,023
that Verizon is turning on our 5G Nationwide network,

336
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:22,729
reaching more than 200 million people across more than 1,800 cities and towns.

337
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:24,932
So, all of the pieces have now come together:

338
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,201
the coverage of 5G Nationwide,

339
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:33,173
the unprecedented performance of 5G Ultra Wideband in more and more cities,

340
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,210
the reliability you expect from Verizon.

341
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:41,582
With the first 5G iPhone on the 5G America has been waiting for,

342
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:46,486
we can finally say, 5G just got real.

343
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:51,558
Hans, this is definitely the start of something big.

344
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,960
Thank you for joining us,

345
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,163
and thank you for all the great work we're doing together.

346
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,733
We are very excited about 5G on iPhone,

347
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,969
and we're going to introduce 5G

348
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:06,206
across our entire lineup of new iPhone models today.

349
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:11,812
So now I'd like to show you the very first iPhone with 5G.

350
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,387
Introducing iPhone 12.

351
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,790
To tell you all about it, I'd like to hand it over to Kaiann.

352
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:03,430
Let's take a closer look at iPhone 12 with 5G.

353
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:06,733
It has an all-new design that's simply stunning.

354
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:09,303
It has smooth, flat edges,

355
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:13,707
allowing the aluminum frame and glass to stay flush, front and back,

356
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:17,077
creating this unique uniform construction.

357
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:19,980
Inside and out, iPhone was re-architected

358
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:24,051
to pack in new technologies into a smaller form factor.

359
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:27,688
iPhone 12 was designed with 5G in mind,

360
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:32,426
including the position of all-new antennas which go around the aluminum frame.

361
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:36,296
The design looks amazing in five stunning new colors:

362
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:41,001
black, white, (PRODUCT)RED, green and a gorgeous blue.

363
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:46,607
iPhone 12 features the same great 6.1-inch display size as iPhone 11,

364
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:50,811
yet we reduced the display borders to create a much smaller iPhone.

365
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:53,146
If we compare it to iPhone 11,

366
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:55,649
iPhone 12 is 11% thinner,

367
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:57,918
15% smaller in volume

368
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,120
and 16% lighter.

369
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:04,057
Keeping the display size and reducing the footprint was only possible

370
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:07,895
by bringing our best display technology to iPhone 12.

371
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:11,598
And that is our Super Retina XDR display.

372
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:16,570
Our new Apple-custom OLED has many advantages over LCD.

373
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:21,942
Each OLED pixel has its own light which can be individually controlled,

374
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:25,412
giving us pixel-precision brightness, rich colors

375
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:28,882
and an amazing two-million-to-one contrast ratio

376
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:32,719
for true blacks in photos, videos, games.

377
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:35,155
And Dark Mode looks fantastic.

378
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:38,926
The new OLED display also has a higher resolution,

379
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:42,062
with twice as many pixels as iPhone 11.

380
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:45,098
It now has 460 pixels per inch.

381
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,602
So text will be sharper for easier reading,

382
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:50,571
and your photos will look better,

383
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:55,242
with more detail, increased dynamic range and precise color.

384
00:22:55,309 --> 00:23:00,747
And peak brightness is nearly twice as high for HDR content: 1,200 nits,

385
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:04,084
and we include support for HDR video formats:

386
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:07,721
Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG.

387
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:11,358
We obsess over making your display impeccable,

388
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:15,529
and of course it's important that we protect your display in the best way.

389
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:19,833
The cover glass on iPhone 11 is the toughest in the industry,

390
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,504
but iPhone 12 leaps ahead with something even better.

391
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,571
Much better.

392
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:27,207
Our incredible Materials Engineering team

393
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:30,077
has been working closely with our partners at Corning,

394
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:31,979
the leaders in glass technology,

395
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:34,882
on a new cutting-edge material.

396
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:37,584
And we call it Ceramic Shield.

397
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:40,020
Ceramic Shield goes beyond glass

398
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:43,490
by adding a new high-temperature crystallization step

399
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:47,194
which grows nanoceramic crystals within the glass matrix

400
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,696
to dramatically improve toughness.

401
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:53,834
To make this material both tough and optically clear,

402
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:56,537
we precisely control the type of crystals

403
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,605
and degree of crystallinity.

404
00:23:58,672 --> 00:24:03,277
This was the breakthrough that made Ceramic Shield possible for iPhone.

405
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:07,581
Ceramic Shield is tougher than any smartphone glass,

406
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:12,052
and along with our new design it makes iPhone more durable than ever.

407
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:16,323
We measured four times better drop performance.

408
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,227
That means if your iPhone accidentally slips out of your pocket,

409
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:24,464
Ceramic Shield will have four times the chance of surviving without cracking.

410
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:29,002
This is the biggest jump in reliability we've ever had on iPhone,

411
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:32,339
and we are thrilled to bring that to iPhone 12.

412
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:36,143
Let's talk more about the 5G capability on iPhone 12.

413
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:40,547
As Tim said, to create the best possible 5G experience

414
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:44,218
it required seamless integration of hardware and software,

415
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:46,620
and partnering closely with carriers.

416
00:24:47,187 --> 00:24:49,323
Here's Arun to tell you more.

417
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:02,102
I'm here in one of our 50 world-class anechoic chambers

418
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,406
where we develop and test advanced wireless capabilities like 5G.

419
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,776
And we approach this differently than anyone else.

420
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:14,681
Starting with hardware, we designed custom 5G antennas and radio components

421
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:19,119
that allow us to target exactly what works best in the entire system.

422
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,555
We can be very space efficient

423
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:25,292
while also including the most 5G bands in a single phone,

424
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,196
to work on 5G in more places than any other smartphone.

425
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:33,901
Another Apple advantage is our ability to engineer a fully integrated system

426
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,869
from silicon to software.

427
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:40,707
We analyzed our entire software stack from applications down to firmware

428
00:25:40,774 --> 00:25:42,743
to take advantage of 5G speeds.

429
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:46,180
For example, we optimized iOS frameworks,

430
00:25:46,246 --> 00:25:49,983
so apps can get the benefit of 5G without using more power.

431
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,519
5G makes iPhone faster.

432
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:57,057
We also made 5G smarter with Smart Data mode.

433
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:59,560
When your iPhone doesn't need 5G speeds,

434
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:02,996
it automatically uses LTE to save battery.

435
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:07,234
But the instant 5G speeds do matter, iPhone starts using it.

436
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:10,337
We also conduct rigorous validation.

437
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:13,440
For example, this custom-built anechoic chamber

438
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:17,010
helps us replicate signals from multiple sources and directions.

439
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:20,747
We use this data to optimize our antenna system

440
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:22,983
and our unique beamforming algorithms.

441
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,352
To deliver 5G around the world,

442
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:28,055
we collaborate closely with carrier partners,

443
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:30,724
ensuring iPhone has great throughput,

444
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:33,627
coverage, call quality and battery life.

445
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:37,798
We've completed 5G testing on over 100 carriers

446
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:39,700
in over 30 regions,

447
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:43,237
and we're seeing impressive peak speeds on iPhone 12.

448
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:47,207
Up to 3.5 gigabits per second in ideal conditions.

449
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:51,211
Of course, 5G speeds will vary by carrier and region.

450
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:55,282
In the US, we also support mmWave,

451
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:59,786
the high frequency version of 5G on all iPhone 12 models.

452
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:04,424
This includes support for Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network.

453
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:08,128
This technology is ideal for densely populated areas

454
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:09,596
and crowded stadiums.

455
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:13,133
With wider bandwidth, it can deliver even higher speeds.

456
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,704
In fact, we have measured over 4 gigabits per second in ideal conditions

457
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:20,741
and up to 1 gigabit per second in typical conditions.

458
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,609
This is just the beginning,

459
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:28,015
and we're excited to offer iPhone users the best possible 5G experience.

460
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,184
Now back to Kaiann.

461
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:35,355
Now let's talk about the chip that powers the new iPhone.

462
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:40,994
The A13 Bionic on iPhone 11 is still the fastest chip in a smartphone.

463
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:42,496
That's until now.

464
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:46,099
We have a new chip developed by our world-class silicon team:

465
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:50,571
A14 Bionic, the fastest chip ever in a smartphone.

466
00:27:50,637 --> 00:27:53,273
Let me quickly take you to our secret chip lab

467
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,375
where Hope will tell you all about it.

468
00:27:55,442 --> 00:27:57,811
[beeping]

469
00:28:04,918 --> 00:28:07,254
And finally, here's Hope.

470
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:12,159
Every year, iPhone sets the standard for mobile performance,

471
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:14,828
even challenging the performance of laptops.

472
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:16,697
This year, A14 Bionic

473
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:20,601
also marks a very important milestone in the history of iPhone.

474
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:24,705
A14 Bionic is the first smartphone chip in the world

475
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:27,841
built on the latest 5-nanometer process technology.

476
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:31,445
The reduction in transistor size enables us to add features

477
00:28:31,512 --> 00:28:32,913
and increase performance,

478
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,716
all while improving energy efficiency.

479
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:37,451
Our Silicon Engineering team

480
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:42,322
has packed 11.8 billion transistors into A14 Bionic,

481
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,726
an increase of nearly 40% compared to A13.

482
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:50,898
A14 improves performance and efficiency across the entire design of the chip,

483
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:52,466
starting with the CPU.

484
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:58,672
The new 6-core CPU in A14 is the fastest CPU in any smartphone.

485
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:01,408
In fact, it's up to 50% faster.

486
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:05,512
A14 also features our latest 4-core GPU design,

487
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,916
driving increased image quality and overall efficiency,

488
00:29:08,982 --> 00:29:12,119
so it's even better for advanced games and machine learning.

489
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:17,090
And compared to the competition, it's the fastest GPU in any smartphone,

490
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:20,594
delivering up to 50% faster graphics.

491
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:23,363
We've also made significant architectural changes

492
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,666
that push the limits of ML processing,

493
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:29,336
a critical design investment to enable new experiences.

494
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:32,773
We've dramatically increased the performance of our Neural Engine

495
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,609
by growing from 8 to 16 cores.

496
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:39,213
This change delivers up to 80% faster performance

497
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,448
on the most critical machine learning models.

498
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:43,116
This new Neural Engine

499
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:47,888
is capable of an astounding 11 trillion operations per second.

500
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:52,559
And we've also increased the performance of our CPU's dedicated ML accelerators,

501
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,661
now 70% faster,

502
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:55,996
so our developers benefit

503
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:59,600
from considerably improved ML performance on our entire chip.

504
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:04,271
Our silicon powers every experience on the iPhone,

505
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:08,275
and with A14 Bionic we make those experiences even better

506
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:11,612
with big updates to our CPU, GPU

507
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:15,048
and a dramatic increase in machine learning capabilities.

508
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:17,017
Back to Kaiann.

509
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:21,522
A14 Bionic enables console-quality games.

510
00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:24,992
With the faster speeds and lower latency of 5G,

511
00:30:25,058 --> 00:30:27,628
multiplayer gaming gets even better.

512
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:32,432
Later this year, one of the best games of all time is coming to iPhone.

513
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,234
It has held the prestigious title

514
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:38,872
of most popular, most played and most viewed game in the world

515
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:40,574
and revolutionized e-sports

516
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:45,245
with over 100 million people watching the world championship last year.

517
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:49,416
I'm, of course, talking about <i>League of Legends.</i>

518
00:30:49,483 --> 00:30:52,252
Using the power of the new A14 Bionic

519
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,389
and Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network,

520
00:30:55,455 --> 00:30:58,559
iPhone gaming is taking an enormous leap forward.

521
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:01,929
Here's Michael Chow, executive producer from Riot Games,

522
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:03,564
to tell you more about it.

523
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,602
At Riot, we aspire to make games that meet our players wherever they are.

524
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:11,738
<i>League of Legends</i> is the world's most popular PC game.

525
00:31:11,805 --> 00:31:16,243
But now with the insanely powerful iPhone 12 and Verizon 5G,

526
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,513
we believe it's the perfect time to bring <i>League</i> to iOS.

527
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,150
This is <i>League of Legends: Wild Rift.</i>

528
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:27,354
The power of A14 Bionic literally blew us away.

529
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:29,656
It allows us to show off champions like Ashe

530
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:34,428
with a brand-new level of fidelity that you can't find on any other platform.

531
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:37,497
With off-the-charts GPU performance and frames per second,

532
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:40,667
you get amazing details and fluid gameplay,

533
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:42,936
even in the most chaotic team fights.

534
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:48,442
On iPhone 12, gameplay is always responsive and unbelievably smooth.

535
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:50,978
Until now, to be competitive in <i>League of Legends,</i>

536
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:52,913
you had to be tied to your desk.

537
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,816
But Verizon 5G frees you to game like a pro

538
00:31:55,883 --> 00:31:58,352
pretty much anywhere, no Wi-Fi required.

539
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:02,089
And with wicked-fast speeds up to 25 times today's networks,

540
00:32:02,155 --> 00:32:05,425
not only is gameplay fast, but so are downloads.

541
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:08,328
So you can instantly grab dope new skins

542
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:10,230
that show off all your favorite champs.

543
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:12,699
We'll see you on the <i>Wild Rift.</i>

544
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:20,674
Wow! What a huge moment for mobile gaming.

545
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:24,178
We can't wait to play <i>League of Legends</i> on iPhone 12.

546
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:29,183
A14 Bionic also combines with our cameras and powerful software

547
00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:33,587
to deliver the new dual-camera system of iPhone 12.

548
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:36,089
It has the Ultra Wide camera that people love

549
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:39,359
and use to take inspiring photos in creative ways.

550
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:42,095
iPhone 12 also has a new Wide camera

551
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:45,499
with an f/1.6 aperture, our fastest yet.

552
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:49,636
This allows more light to hit the sensor, making every photo better.

553
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:51,605
Along with the wider aperture,

554
00:32:51,672 --> 00:32:54,274
we developed our first 7-element lens

555
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:57,744
to maintain sharp detail in your photo from edge to edge.

556
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:02,616
This delivers a 27% improvement in low-light performance,

557
00:33:02,683 --> 00:33:06,653
so photos and videos all around will have less noise and brighter results.

558
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,490
Like in this photo, with fantastic detail in her hair, clothing,

559
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:11,959
and the sun's reflection.

560
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:16,063
On top of this, we use computational photography

561
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:19,032
to deliver even more powerful new features.

562
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:23,203
Our Smart HDR 3 continues to bring out details in faces,

563
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,240
like you see here when the sun is so bright behind her.

564
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:28,542
Now it understands scenes with machine learning

565
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:31,778
and applies more adjustments to distinct parts of the photo.

566
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:35,782
For example, Smart HDR 3 brings out more detail in the rocks

567
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:40,287
and uses sky segmentation to adjust for color, contrast and noise.

568
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:44,091
Computational photography also enables Night mode,

569
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:46,793
which has been called the best in the industry.

570
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,696
Night mode on iPhone 12 gets even better.

571
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:52,199
The faster aperture captures more light.

572
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:56,703
And now, we are expanding Night mode to all cameras of iPhone 12,

573
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,872
for the first time on the Ultra Wide

574
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:02,876
and front TrueDepth camera, which is perfect for Night mode selfies.

575
00:34:02,943 --> 00:34:04,811
This is without a flash.

576
00:34:05,312 --> 00:34:07,414
These cameras are incredible.

577
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:10,584
Let's take a look at other photos shot on iPhone 12.

578
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:13,120
This photo makes use of the Ultra Wide lens

579
00:34:13,187 --> 00:34:17,124
while maintaining sharpness and clarity like you see in the branches and leaves.

580
00:34:17,191 --> 00:34:19,960
Here's another Ultra Wide photo, shot from below.

581
00:34:20,027 --> 00:34:24,331
Just look at the amazing details in the clothing and chandeliers.

582
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:26,400
In this low-light portrait photo,

583
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:30,037
the color and warm light in the background come together seamlessly.

584
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:33,574
For video, iPhone continues to lead the industry

585
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,909
with the highest-quality video.

586
00:34:35,976 --> 00:34:39,780
And with the larger aperture, iPhone 12 video will get even better,

587
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:42,182
with big improvements in lower light.

588
00:34:42,983 --> 00:34:45,052
We're adding Night mode time-lapse,

589
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:48,589
with longer exposure and brighter frames when using a tripod.

590
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:51,358
We wanted to show you iPhone 12 in action,

591
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:55,495
so here's a video we shot and edited entirely on iPhone 12.

592
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:58,632
["Why iii Love the Moon" by Phony Ppl playing]

593
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:43,310
With an amazing camera on the go and 5G speeds,

594
00:35:43,377 --> 00:35:47,014
iPhone 12 takes us into an even more wireless world.

595
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:51,151
We love wireless charging, but want to improve the experience.

596
00:35:51,218 --> 00:35:55,289
When setting down your phone, you can miss the exact center of the charger,

597
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:59,293
which can result in slow, less efficient charging, or none at all.

598
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:03,063
So with iPhone 12, we are making this so much better.

599
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,731
But that's not all.

600
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,656
Introducing MagSafe for iPhone.

601
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:31,859
To tell you more, here's Deniz.

602
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:38,365
MagSafe is an advanced new system.

603
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:41,235
It starts by improving the wireless charging experience.

604
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:44,471
Our wound wire coil, which is unique in the industry,

605
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:46,039
now accommodates magnets

606
00:36:46,106 --> 00:36:48,909
and maintains compatibility with existing Qi chargers.

607
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:52,079
The magnets are optimized for alignment and efficiency.

608
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:53,780
And we improved our shielding design

609
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:57,184
to safely provide up to 15 watts for faster charging.

610
00:36:57,251 --> 00:37:01,255
We use a custom nanocrystalline shield to capture magnetic flux.

611
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:03,323
We also added two new sensors:

612
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:07,027
a single-turn coil NFC and a sensitive magnetometer,

613
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:10,230
which senses magnetic field strength and can instantly react to it.

614
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:13,534
This enables iPhone 12 to recognize and provide

615
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,669
a better experience for accessories.

616
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:19,106
Any MagSafe accessory can simply snap onto the back of iPhone.

617
00:37:19,173 --> 00:37:20,340
So, this is really great.

618
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:23,110
We're enabling a whole new ecosystem for MagSafe,

619
00:37:23,177 --> 00:37:25,812
starting with all-new cases for iPhone 12:

620
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:28,081
silicone, clear, leather...

621
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:31,552
which have magnets to snap on and off, and they're far easier to use.

622
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:34,788
And you can use other MagSafe accessories on top of the cases,

623
00:37:34,855 --> 00:37:36,390
like the MagSafe charger.

624
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:40,327
And there's a MagSafe wallet. It just snaps to the back of iPhone

625
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:42,629
and also works on top of MagSafe cases.

626
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:44,932
The leather sleeve uses MagSafe sensors

627
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:48,068
to identify when iPhone is inside to reveal the clock.

628
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:50,737
We also developed the new MagSafe Duo Charger

629
00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:52,906
for your iPhone and Apple Watch.

630
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:55,642
You can charge both devices with one charger,

631
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:58,579
and it folds up easily for when you travel.

632
00:37:58,645 --> 00:38:01,348
And these are just the accessories we are introducing.

633
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:04,418
Belkin is already working on a couple of new accessories:

634
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:07,087
a car mount and a multi-charger dock.

635
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:10,858
We can't wait to see the innovative ways that others will use MagSafe,

636
00:38:10,924 --> 00:38:14,161
creating a robust and ever-expanding ecosystem.

637
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:15,629
Back to you, Kaiann.

638
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,434
We also have some big environmental news for iPhone.

639
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,769
To tell you more, here's Lisa.

640
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:39,386
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for our global corporate operations.

641
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:45,025
Our offices, stores and data centers run on 100% renewable energy.

642
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:47,427
And we're proud of how far we've come.

643
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:49,796
But by 2030,

644
00:38:49,863 --> 00:38:54,935
we plan to have net zero climate impact across our entire business,

645
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:59,239
including our manufacturing supply chain and all product life cycles.

646
00:38:59,306 --> 00:39:02,376
This means that every Apple device sold,

647
00:39:02,442 --> 00:39:05,279
from material collection, component manufacturing,

648
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:09,616
assembly, transport, customer use, charging,

649
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:12,419
all the way through recycling and material recovery

650
00:39:12,486 --> 00:39:15,155
will be 100% carbon neutral.

651
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:20,727
Many of iPhone 12's environmental features build on our past progress,

652
00:39:20,794 --> 00:39:25,999
removing harmful chemicals and using renewable and recyclable materials.

653
00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:28,235
And now, for the first time,

654
00:39:28,302 --> 00:39:33,473
we are using 100% recycled rare earth elements in all magnets,

655
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,743
including the camera, haptics and MagSafe.

656
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:40,547
We've also been transitioning our iPhone manufacturing partners

657
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:42,015
to renewable energy.

658
00:39:42,082 --> 00:39:44,651
And just like we did with Apple Watch,

659
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:47,988
we looked for ways to cut waste and use less material.

660
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:52,893
Customers already have over 700 million Lightning headphones.

661
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,763
And many customers have moved to a wireless experience

662
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,334
with AirPods, Beats or other wireless headphones.

663
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,439
And there are also over two billion Apple power adapters out in the world,

664
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:09,009
and that's not counting the billions of third-party adapters.

665
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:12,613
So we are removing these items from the iPhone box,

666
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,648
which reduces carbon emissions

667
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:18,185
and avoids the mining and use of precious materials.

668
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:22,422
Removing these items also means a smaller, lighter iPhone box.

669
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:26,326
We can fit up to 70% more products on a shipping pallet,

670
00:40:26,393 --> 00:40:30,297
reducing carbon emissions in our global logistics chain.

671
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:35,235
Taken altogether, the changes we've made for iPhone 12

672
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:40,574
cut over two million metric tons of carbon emissions annually.

673
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:47,080
It's like removing 450,000 cars from the road per year.

674
00:40:47,147 --> 00:40:51,618
This is huge, and we're really proud that Apple is taking the lead.

675
00:40:51,685 --> 00:40:53,120
We hope others will follow,

676
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:55,856
making this impact even bigger for our planet.

677
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,758
Back to you, Kaiann.

678
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:10,204
Now every iPhone will include the more advanced and higher power

679
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,439
USB-C to Lightning Cable.

680
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:17,177
It can be used with any standard USB-C power adapter or computer port.

681
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:19,613
And USB-C enables fast charging.

682
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:23,116
So that's iPhone 12 with 5G.

683
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:25,986
But to add to all these big announcements,

684
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:29,323
we also wanted to do something a little different.

685
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:32,492
["James Bond Theme" playing]

686
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:35,128

00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:53,614
This is iPhone 12 mini.

691
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,783
With its amazing size, it fits in the palm of your hand,

692
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:01,889
while still keeping the expansive edge-to-edge Super Retina XDR display.

693
00:42:01,955 --> 00:42:06,326
It's smaller and lighter than our 4.7-inch models like iPhone 8,

694
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:11,265
but with a larger 5.4-inch display that lets you see so much more.

695
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:12,666
With its compact size,

696
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:17,638
the iPhone 12 mini has the exact same features as iPhone 12.

697
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:20,607
You're just choosing between two great sizes.

698
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:24,278
In fact, iPhone 12 mini is the smallest, thinnest

699
00:42:24,344 --> 00:42:27,314
and lightest 5G phone in the world.

700
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:30,050
With its large screen and compact size,

701
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:33,020
we think this will be an incredibly popular iPhone.

702
00:42:33,086 --> 00:42:37,658
Everything on iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini is the latest:

703
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:41,428
5G, the fastest chip with A14 Bionic,

704
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:43,630
most advanced display with OLED,

705
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,699
all-new design with Ceramic Shield,

706
00:42:45,766 --> 00:42:49,102
even better water resistance, new cameras for low light,

707
00:42:49,169 --> 00:42:50,237
and MagSafe.

708
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:53,473
Let's see everything iPhone 12 can do.

709
00:42:58,478 --> 00:43:00,747
["Eat Them Apples" by Suzi Wu playing]

710
00:43:26,406 --> 00:43:28,475
[camera shutter clicking]

711
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:29,837
Even with these huge updates,

712
00:44:29,903 --> 00:44:35,676
the iPhone 12 lineup will start at just $699 for iPhone 12 mini

713
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:38,478
and $799 for iPhone 12.

714
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:43,317
We also have great financing options from Apple as well as our partners.

715
00:44:43,383 --> 00:44:46,486
This includes a very special offer from Verizon.

716
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:49,089
If you trade in an iPhone X or newer,

717
00:44:49,156 --> 00:44:50,624
you can get iPhone 12

718
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:54,561
starting at $15 per month for 24 months,

719
00:44:54,628 --> 00:44:58,098
or iPhone 12 mini for just $12 per month.

720
00:44:58,165 --> 00:45:02,169
This is an unprecedented leap forward for iPhone.

721
00:45:02,236 --> 00:45:05,372
There is simply nothing like iPhone 12.

722
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:06,974
Back to you, Tim.

723
00:45:25,492 --> 00:45:29,796
iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are absolutely amazing.

724
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:32,533
They are the start of a new era for iPhone.

725
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:36,103
Yet that's just half of our iPhone story today.

726
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,973
We want to take it even further with our pro line of iPhones.

727
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,608
And here they are.

728
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:25,385
This is iPhone 12 Pro.

729
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:28,522
I'd like to hand it over to Joz to tell you all about it.

730
00:46:34,361 --> 00:46:35,896
iPhone 12 Pro is designed

731
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:39,433
for our users who want the absolute most from their iPhone.

732
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:43,704
It takes our new design even further with premium materials.

733
00:46:44,872 --> 00:46:49,943
This includes a durable and beautiful surgical-grade stainless steel band

734
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,346
and precision-milled back glass.

735
00:46:52,746 --> 00:46:56,416
They come in four new finishes, including an elegant silver,

736
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:59,186
a rich, deep graphite, a stunning gold

737
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:02,155
and an all-new Pacific Blue.

738
00:47:02,222 --> 00:47:04,691
They're engineered with an advanced PVD process

739
00:47:04,758 --> 00:47:07,227
that provides a spectacular luster.

740
00:47:07,294 --> 00:47:10,664
And our new gold uses a high-power magnetron coating process

741
00:47:10,731 --> 00:47:14,134
that gives the stainless steel a stunning bright gold finish.

742
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:18,605
The pro models also feature our incredibly durable Ceramic Shield.

743
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:22,276
And these models have best-in-class water and dust resistance

744
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:23,877
with an IP68 rating,

745
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:28,315
so they can withstand submersion at up to six meters for 30 minutes.

746
00:47:29,082 --> 00:47:33,954
The pro design is complemented beautifully with our new MagSafe accessories

747
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:37,858
which provide easy and secure attachment and high-power charging.

748
00:47:38,225 --> 00:47:39,459
iPhone 12 Pro features

749
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:42,863
our industry-leading Super Retina XDR displays.

750
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:50,304
We were able to go from today's 5.8-inch to a much larger 6.1-inch display.

751
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:54,608
And iPhone 12 Pro Max increases from today's 6.5-inch

752
00:47:54,675 --> 00:47:57,845
to a more expansive 6.7-inch display.

753
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:00,113
We were able to grow these displays

754
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,383
but keep the form factors nearly identical.

755
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:06,220
So for people who want our biggest displays,

756
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:09,022
this is the largest display ever in an iPhone,

757
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:10,924
with our highest resolution,

758
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:13,527
featuring nearly three and a half million pixels.

759
00:48:14,461 --> 00:48:16,663
HDR video comes to life.

760
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:20,801
High-resolution HDR movies and TV shows that you stream over 5G

761
00:48:20,868 --> 00:48:22,769
will look amazing.

762
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:26,740
Our pro models are packed with pro-level performance.

763
00:48:26,807 --> 00:48:30,277
While our competition is scrambling to catch up with our chips from last year,

764
00:48:30,344 --> 00:48:32,546
we remain generations ahead.

765
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:36,316
And our advantages go beyond the CPU and GPU.

766
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:39,553
Together with our Image Signal Processor, or ISP,

767
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,557
they enable powerful computational photography for camera experiences

768
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:46,793
that simply are not possible with traditional cameras.

769
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:51,798
For example, Deep Fusion uses machine learning on the Neural Engine

770
00:48:51,865 --> 00:48:54,601
for pixel-by-pixel processing of photos

771
00:48:54,668 --> 00:48:59,273
with unprecedented detail, texture and minimal noise.

772
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:05,312
To accomplish this, Deep Fusion uses all the compute engines of the A14.

773
00:49:06,146 --> 00:49:08,382
Our camera sensor captures multiple images

774
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:11,552
and processes them through the ISP.

775
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:14,254
The CPU computes the alignment of the frames.

776
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:16,557
The GPU pre-processes the images

777
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:19,293
before running them through the Neural Engine.

778
00:49:19,927 --> 00:49:23,263
And then there's additional post-processing done in the GPU.

779
00:49:23,897 --> 00:49:29,169
With A14 Bionic, we are able to bring Deep Fusion to all four cameras

780
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:30,771
of iPhone 12 Pro,

781
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:33,740
including the front-facing TrueDepth camera.

782
00:49:34,775 --> 00:49:37,644
We combine state-of-the-art camera hardware

783
00:49:37,711 --> 00:49:39,646
with this amazing compute power

784
00:49:39,713 --> 00:49:43,650
to create a pro camera system that is unlike any other device.

785
00:49:45,018 --> 00:49:48,021
iPhone 12 Pro features our amazing Ultra Wide camera

786
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:51,024
with a 120-degree field of view,

787
00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:55,028
and our new Wide camera with faster f/1.6 aperture

788
00:49:55,095 --> 00:49:59,700
and 7-element lens that lets in 27% more light.

789
00:49:59,766 --> 00:50:05,239
iPhone 12 Pro also features a 52 mm Telephoto camera for stunning portraits.

790
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:09,309
So iPhone 12 Pro delivers high-quality optical images

791
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:11,378
at three different focal lengths,

792
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:13,881
with a 4x optical zoom range.

793
00:50:14,615 --> 00:50:17,217
The larger size of the iPhone 12 Pro Max

794
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:21,455
provided us with an opportunity to do even more with our pro camera system.

795
00:50:21,955 --> 00:50:24,224
And here's Andrew to tell you all about it.

796
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:47,981
In iPhone 12 Pro Max, we've been able to create our best camera ever.

797
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:53,320
We have a brand-new Telephoto camera with a 65 mm focal length.

798
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,324
Moving from a 52 mm focal length to a 65 mm

799
00:50:57,391 --> 00:51:00,894
allows for longer framing in the classic portrait style.

800
00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:05,065
With the new Telephoto, you can now optically zoom in two and a half times

801
00:51:05,132 --> 00:51:07,935
for even closer shots or tighter crops,

802
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:11,738
which means improving to a 5x optical zoom range

803
00:51:11,805 --> 00:51:16,176
from the Ultra Wide's 13 mm to the Telephoto's 65 mm.

804
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:20,614
iPhone 12 Pro Max features an all-new massive Wide camera

805
00:51:20,681 --> 00:51:23,650
with an f/1.6 aperture, a new sensor

806
00:51:23,717 --> 00:51:28,188
and new system for Optical Image Stabilization, or OIS.

807
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:30,257
Let me first tell you about the new sensor.

808
00:51:30,324 --> 00:51:36,129
It's 47% larger, with 1.7 micron pixels, our largest yet.

809
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:38,932
Larger pixels plus a faster aperture

810
00:51:38,999 --> 00:51:40,801
gives iPhone 12 Pro Max

811
00:51:40,868 --> 00:51:44,538
an incredible 87% improvement in low light,

812
00:51:44,605 --> 00:51:47,774
which is our biggest leap in light gathering capability.

813
00:51:48,642 --> 00:51:51,378
On top of that, we developed a completely new system

814
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:53,714
for optical image stabilization

815
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,417
that adopts a high-end DSLR approach called sensor-shift.

816
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:00,988
Sensor-shift applies stabilization to the sensor

817
00:52:01,054 --> 00:52:02,823
instead of the heavier lens

818
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:08,061
to precisely control motion in X and Y while maintaining sharpness.

819
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:11,665
This cancels both low and high-frequency disturbances

820
00:52:11,732 --> 00:52:14,368
like hand movement or vibrations in a car.

821
00:52:15,102 --> 00:52:18,672
In addition, the OIS on all our Wide cameras this year

822
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:22,176
can now make 5,000 micro adjustments per second,

823
00:52:22,242 --> 00:52:24,645
which is five times more than last year.

824
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:27,881
Along with motion processing advancements,

825
00:52:27,948 --> 00:52:31,885
we get stabilized exposure times of up to two seconds in low light

826
00:52:31,952 --> 00:52:33,554
for handheld shots,

827
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:37,024
equal to a full f-stop increase in light gathering.

828
00:52:37,925 --> 00:52:40,961
This sensor-shift system is unique to Apple

829
00:52:41,028 --> 00:52:43,564
and helps people capture everyday situations

830
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,599
with extraordinary images.

831
00:52:46,066 --> 00:52:50,204
And it delivers steady video with a truly cinematic feel.

832
00:52:50,804 --> 00:52:53,807
Now here's my colleague Alok to tell you more about another feature

833
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:55,776
we created for our pro users.

834
00:52:58,312 --> 00:53:00,914
These are amazing cameras for pros,

835
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:03,417
and we want to give our pros even more control

836
00:53:03,483 --> 00:53:05,853
over the images they capture.

837
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,288
Many pros love to capture in RAW,

838
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:11,792
but they're missing the benefit of our sophisticated image fusion.

839
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:14,728
So we'd like to show you a sneak peek of a new feature

840
00:53:14,795 --> 00:53:17,130
that combines the control of shooting in RAW

841
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:20,400
with the power of our computational photography.

842
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:23,370
And that's Apple ProRAW.

843
00:53:23,437 --> 00:53:25,639
This will be an incredible feature for pros

844
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:27,941
and will be available in the iPhone Camera app

845
00:53:28,008 --> 00:53:32,012
on iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max later this year.

846
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:36,416
It provides many of the benefits of our multi-frame image processing

847
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:38,418
and computational photography,

848
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:41,288
like Deep Fusion and Smart HDR,

849
00:53:41,355 --> 00:53:45,158
and combines them with the depth and flexibility of a RAW format.

850
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:48,829
In order to achieve this, we constructed a new pipeline

851
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:50,764
that takes components of the processing

852
00:53:50,831 --> 00:53:54,868
we do in our CPU, GPU, ISP and Neural Engine

853
00:53:54,935 --> 00:53:57,471
and combines them into a new Deep Image file

854
00:53:57,538 --> 00:54:00,941
computed at the time of capture without any shutter delay.

855
00:54:01,475 --> 00:54:03,410
And we do this for all four cameras,

856
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:05,779
dynamically adapting for various scenes

857
00:54:05,846 --> 00:54:08,315
while maintaining our intuitive camera experience.

858
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:12,286
Things like sharpening, white balance and tone mapping

859
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:15,455
become instructions rather than being baked into the photo,

860
00:54:15,522 --> 00:54:20,127
delivering full creative control over color, detail and dynamic range.

861
00:54:20,794 --> 00:54:24,231
Here you can see a photo shot with Apple ProRAW.

862
00:54:24,298 --> 00:54:26,967
Notice how it's taken full advantage of Deep Fusion

863
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:30,804
to capture a wide range of light and shadow from multiple exposures.

864
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:34,241
Because all the data is contained in Apple ProRAW,

865
00:54:34,308 --> 00:54:36,410
this image can be processed in various ways

866
00:54:36,476 --> 00:54:39,746
while retaining the crisp, beautifully rendered detail.

867
00:54:40,347 --> 00:54:43,617
You can edit Apple ProRAW directly in our Photos app

868
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:46,720
and other professional photo editing apps.

869
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:49,223
We're also creating an API for third-party apps

870
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:52,192
to capture images in Apple ProRAW.

871
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,462
This is really the best of both worlds.

872
00:54:55,529 --> 00:55:00,267
The flexibility of RAW with the power of Apple's computational photography.

873
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:02,469
And now, back to Joz.

874
00:55:05,672 --> 00:55:09,810
iPhone 12 Pro allows you to take absolutely stunning photos.

875
00:55:10,444 --> 00:55:15,282
Even at dusk, you can see the incredible color and texture in the shadows.

876
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:18,418
You can see this Ultra Wide shot preserves the detail

877
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:20,721
in the cracks of the desert floor.

878
00:55:20,787 --> 00:55:22,256
You can almost feel it.

879
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:25,559
With Deep Fusion, you can even see the detail of her dress

880
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:27,160
in this low-light setting.

881
00:55:27,728 --> 00:55:29,296
In this classic black-and-white,

882
00:55:29,363 --> 00:55:32,032
you can feel the sun glistening on the horse.

883
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,869
On a tripod, we can take Night mode even further,

884
00:55:35,936 --> 00:55:40,541
capturing the pop of color in the tent as well as the stars in the night sky.

885
00:55:40,908 --> 00:55:43,110
Now let's talk about pro video.

886
00:55:43,577 --> 00:55:44,678
Year after year,

887
00:55:44,745 --> 00:55:47,714
iPhone provides the highest quality video on a smartphone.

888
00:55:48,215 --> 00:55:52,419
Pros use iPhone to shoot TV shows, news reports and even movies.

889
00:55:53,053 --> 00:55:57,391
This has never been more important, as our homes have become our studios.

890
00:55:57,958 --> 00:56:02,129
In fact, for many TV productions, from <i>American Idol</i> to <i>Mythic Quest,</i>

891
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:05,399
the show has been able to go on because of iPhone.

892
00:56:05,866 --> 00:56:08,936
This year, we're taking pro video further, much further.

893
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:13,473
For the first time, we're bringing HDR video recording to iPhone.

894
00:56:14,007 --> 00:56:18,111
You can now record in 10-bit High Dynamic Range.

895
00:56:18,178 --> 00:56:22,449
This means we can capture over 700 million colors.

896
00:56:22,516 --> 00:56:25,052
That's 60 times more colors than before.

897
00:56:25,485 --> 00:56:28,589
While you capture, you get a live preview of your HDR content

898
00:56:28,655 --> 00:56:31,225
on the Super Retina XDR display.

899
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:35,529
And we're also gonna do something that no other device in the world can do.

900
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:38,198
iPhone 12 Pro is the first camera

901
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:40,534
to record in Dolby Vision HDR.

902
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:45,138
To accomplish this, every single frame of 10-bit video

903
00:56:45,205 --> 00:56:48,342
runs through our ISP, generating a histogram

904
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:52,112
and allowing iPhone to grade each frame in Dolby Vision,

905
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:54,081
live while you're recording.

906
00:56:54,147 --> 00:56:58,151
And we can do this at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second.

907
00:56:58,652 --> 00:57:01,288
This is enabled by our Apple custom sensor

908
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:03,524
and the incredible power of the A14,

909
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:07,828
which does the intense processing of these image algorithms in real time.

910
00:57:08,395 --> 00:57:12,065
Prior to today, you needed a pro studio lab and special equipment

911
00:57:12,132 --> 00:57:16,637
to edit your original Dolby Vision footage and then re-encode your files.

912
00:57:16,703 --> 00:57:20,541
iPhone 12 Pro will be the first device to edit in Dolby Vision,

913
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:22,342
right from the Photos app.

914
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:24,178
You can even apply filters.

915
00:57:24,811 --> 00:57:29,016
iPhone will regenerate the Dolby Vision tuning on the fly.

916
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:33,687
Oscar-winning cinematographer Emmanuel "Chivo" Lubezki made a film

917
00:57:33,754 --> 00:57:36,924
to showcase iPhone 12 Pro with Dolby Vision,

918
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:38,792
and I'd like to show it to you now.

919
00:57:43,897 --> 00:57:48,135
<i>My name is Emmanuel Lubezki.</i> <i>I am a cinematographer.</i>

920
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:53,607
<i>When I started shooting movies,</i> <i>you had to rent a very expensive camera,</i>

921
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:56,777
<i>buy film stock, pay for developing,</i>

922
00:57:56,844 --> 00:57:59,413
<i>special equipment for editing.</i>

923
00:58:00,347 --> 00:58:05,752
<i>Now, you can really go out with</i> <i>one of these devices and make a movie.</i>

924
00:58:08,522 --> 00:58:13,594
<i>The iPhone Pro will allow filmmakers</i> <i>all around the world to make films</i>

925
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,431
<i>that otherwise are impossible</i> <i>because you don't have the means</i>

926
00:58:17,497 --> 00:58:21,168
<i>or because the cameras are too heavy</i> <i>or too complicated.</i>

927
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:28,942
<i>I think the next great cinematographer</i> <i>or the next great film director</i>

928
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:32,546
<i>is already making movies</i> <i>with one of these devices.</i>

929
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:40,754
So iPhone is the first and only device

930
00:58:40,821 --> 00:58:46,326
that enables you to capture, edit, watch and share Dolby Vision video.

931
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,830
What an incredible end-to-end pro video workflow,

932
00:58:49,897 --> 00:58:51,098
right from your pocket.

933
00:58:51,598 --> 00:58:55,903
And with 5G, sharing your videos from the field has never been faster.

934
00:58:56,336 --> 00:59:00,174
And we have another exciting capability we're bringing to our new pro iPhones.

935
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,242
Here's Francesca to tell you more.

936
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:13,754
We've pushed the industry with depth technology over the years,

937
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,857
and today we continue that innovation with...

938
00:59:16,924 --> 00:59:18,458
a LiDAR scanner.

939
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:21,962
LiDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging,

940
00:59:22,029 --> 00:59:26,133
and it measures how long it takes light to reach an object and reflect back.

941
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,435
We've adopted this technology for iPhone,

942
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:32,206
and with the machine learning and depth frameworks of iOS 14,

943
00:59:32,272 --> 00:59:34,575
iPhone understands the world around you

944
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:36,877
and builds a precise depth map of the scene.

945
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:41,748
It enables object and room scanning, photo and video effects

946
00:59:41,815 --> 00:59:44,818
and precise placement of AR objects.

947
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:47,788
LiDAR makes iPhone 12 Pro a powerful device

948
00:59:47,855 --> 00:59:52,159
for delivering instant AR and unlocking endless opportunities in apps.

949
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:55,395
The LiDAR scanner also takes our pro camera system

950
00:59:55,462 --> 00:59:56,964
to a whole new level.

951
00:59:57,631 --> 00:59:59,900
With LiDAR's ability to see in the dark,

952
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:02,436
we use it for autofocus in low-light scenes,

953
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:06,106
improving accuracy to focus and reducing capture time.

954
01:00:06,173 --> 01:00:08,008
Instead of hunting for focus,

955
01:00:08,075 --> 01:00:10,878
the LiDAR scanner can identify the subject,

956
01:00:10,944 --> 01:00:13,413
focus and capture right away.

957
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,782
This works in photos and videos.

958
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:19,987
In fact, with LiDAR, we can improve focus time in low-light scenes

959
01:00:20,053 --> 01:00:22,055
by up to six times,

960
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:25,792
so your subject is clearly in focus, without missing the moment.

961
01:00:26,527 --> 01:00:30,063
LiDAR also improves depth in low light for Night mode,

962
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:33,667
enabling stunning Night mode portrait shots like this one.

963
01:00:34,368 --> 01:00:37,104
Look at the incredible detail in the face,

964
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:39,406
the realistic color throughout the scene

965
01:00:39,473 --> 01:00:42,309
and the blooming bokeh in the lights in the background.

966
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:46,880
And that's the new LiDAR scanner on iPhone 12 Pro.

967
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:48,815
Now back to Joz.

968
01:00:50,717 --> 01:00:55,455
As you can see, iPhone 12 Pro is loaded with incredible innovations.

969
01:00:55,522 --> 01:00:58,759
And when you combine these advanced capabilities with 5G,

970
01:00:58,825 --> 01:01:02,162
it will enable you to do so much more on the go.

971
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:06,466
And 5G is going to unlock even more opportunities for our developers.

972
01:01:06,533 --> 01:01:08,435
I'd like to show you a couple examples.

973
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:14,875
On-call physicians often need to review complex medical scans anywhere, anytime.

974
01:01:14,942 --> 01:01:20,681
OsiriX HD app and 5G enables them to download these very large images

975
01:01:20,747 --> 01:01:22,449
with lightning-fast speeds.

976
01:01:22,516 --> 01:01:25,118
The ability to download a full diagnostic scan

977
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:27,855
in a matter of seconds versus minutes

978
01:01:27,921 --> 01:01:31,358
can make the difference between life and death for a stroke victim.

979
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:34,661
And enterprise will be able to use private 5G networks

980
01:01:34,728 --> 01:01:37,331
for high reliability and low-latency apps.

981
01:01:37,831 --> 01:01:42,169
Like JigSpace, which accelerates setup of complex work spaces.

982
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:44,505
To set up a medical device production facility,

983
01:01:44,571 --> 01:01:48,809
Medtronic would normally create a Six Sigma cardboard layout of the space,

984
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:52,813
taking weeks to design and costing tens of thousands of dollars.

985
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,049
And now, with 5G and the new LiDAR scanner,

986
01:01:56,116 --> 01:01:59,620
iPhone 12 Pro enables teams to immediately map the environment

987
01:01:59,686 --> 01:02:01,889
and collaborate with their colleagues

988
01:02:01,955 --> 01:02:04,191
to instantly place simulated equipment,

989
01:02:04,258 --> 01:02:08,228
adapt it to the room layout and outline process flows.

990
01:02:08,295 --> 01:02:10,931
JigSpace on iPhone 12 Pro enabled Medtronic

991
01:02:10,998 --> 01:02:15,335
to completely transform projects from weeks to hours,

992
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:18,772
reducing costs by more than 90%.

993
01:02:19,339 --> 01:02:24,678
We really pushed the limits with iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max

994
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:27,447
with stunning new designs and larger displays.

995
01:02:27,514 --> 01:02:30,584
They're packed with our most innovative technologies

996
01:02:30,651 --> 01:02:34,121
like the A14 Bionic chip, LiDAR scanner

997
01:02:34,188 --> 01:02:38,525
and incredible pro camera system powered by computational photography.

998
01:02:39,026 --> 01:02:42,729
And now, here's a short film we created about the iPhone 12 Pro.

999
01:02:45,032 --> 01:02:46,934
[man narrating] <i>A singular new design.</i>

1000
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,069
<i>A reengineered chip.</i>

1001
01:02:49,136 --> 01:02:50,704
<i>And 5G.</i>

1002
01:02:51,205 --> 01:02:53,540
<i>This is iPhone 12 Pro.</i>

1003
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:58,212
<i>The vertical band is precision-machined</i> <i>from stainless steel.</i>

1004
01:02:59,313 --> 01:03:03,717
<i>The Ceramic Shield on the front</i> <i>is tougher than any smartphone glass.</i>

1005
01:03:05,118 --> 01:03:09,756
<i>And tighter borders allow for</i> <i>even larger Super Retina XDR displays.</i>

1006
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:16,096
<i>5G is set to change the world</i> <i>with radically faster speeds.</i>

1007
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:21,368
<i>The hardware and software have been</i> <i>optimized for the best 5G experience.</i>

1008
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:25,739
<i>A14 Bionic has a smaller,</i> <i>5-nanometer transistor,</i>

1009
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:30,544
<i>which pushes the most powerful chip</i> <i>in a smartphone generations ahead.</i>

1010
01:03:31,845 --> 01:03:33,814
<i>A new and improved pro camera system</i>

1011
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:36,583
<i>makes the 12 Pro</i> <i>the photographer's iPhone.</i>

1012
01:03:37,451 --> 01:03:41,822
<i>The larger iPhone 12 Pro Max</i> <i>pushes these innovations even further.</i>

1013
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:46,527
<i>Its bigger sensor</i> <i>dramatically increases the detail captured</i>

1014
01:03:46,593 --> 01:03:50,097
<i>and helps improve low-light performance</i> <i>by 87%.</i>

1015
01:03:53,567 --> 01:03:55,769
<i>The custom-designed LiDAR scanner</i>

1016
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:59,640
<i>puts advanced depth-mapping technology</i> <i>in your pocket.</i>

1017
01:03:59,706 --> 01:04:02,075
<i>You can now take a Night mode portrait</i>

1018
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:06,113
<i>and unlock a new world of possibilities</i> <i>for augmented reality.</i>

1019
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:15,656
<i>iPhone 12 Pro smashes the benchmark</i> <i>for highest quality video in a smartphone.</i>

1020
01:04:19,993 --> 01:04:23,764
<i>The movie industry can now count on it</i> <i>as an essential piece of equipment.</i>

1021
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:30,871
<i>It is the world's first device</i> <i>able to capture, play back and edit</i>

1022
01:04:30,938 --> 01:04:34,141
<i>10-bit HDR footage with Dolby Vision.</i>

1023
01:04:35,609 --> 01:04:38,712
<i>iPhone 12 Pro comes in two sizes</i>

1024
01:04:38,779 --> 01:04:41,949
<i>and in four finishes,</i> <i>including new Pacific Blue.</i>

1025
01:04:44,284 --> 01:04:47,788
<i>An integral part of this year's design</i> <i>is MagSafe,</i>

1026
